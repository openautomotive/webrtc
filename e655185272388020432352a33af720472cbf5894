      "message": "I don\u0027t think I have enough context to review this, but this doesn\u0027t seem like a step in the right direction. You\u0027ve split a type that encapsulates both size and position into two separate fields and the only rationale (unless I\u0027m missing something) is that you don\u0027t want the overhead of copying/moving the size because in your use-case it will always be the same. This seems like a classic case of premature optimization (would that additional overhead actually matter?), and it\u0027s fragile in the sense that these new functions could easily be used in the future in a scenario where the size is not the same. It\u0027s also made it more awkward to construct one of these because it\u0027s now necessary to call set_top_left() after construction (although I\u0027m a bit surprised you didn\u0027t need to modify more call-sites than you have done here).\n\nI think this would be clearer if the two new methods acted as assignment operators (maybe you could even overload operator\u003d), as that\u0027s a lot simpler to reason about. Having a separate MoveFrameInfoFrom might be a worthwhile optimization, since |updated_region| might be costly to copy, but I don\u0027t really have enough context to be sure.",
