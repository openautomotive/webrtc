      "message": "I think the purpose of this test is \"SetXContent fails if underlying media channel fails to process codecs\", which is being simulated with \"set_fail_set_recv_codecs\". If so, the test should pass in a normally-constructed Content instead of an empty one, to ensure the failure isn\u0027t just due to the Content being empty.",
