      "message": "Let me see if I understand this: content_rect is the content area of the window, and rgn_rect is the portion of it that Windows renders to the screen; correct? So for most apps they are the same, but for shaped windows they will be different, and it\u0027s possible that an app chooses a rectangular shape that is not the same as its content area.\n\nI think this could benefit from being factored out of this method, perhaps into a helper function alongside GetWindowContentRect. I suggest something like:\n\n  bool GetWindowRegionBoundingRect(DesktopRect* rect, int* region_type);\n\nThis will make this code a bit more readable because the semantics of content_rect won\u0027t then be changing based on region_type like it is now.",
