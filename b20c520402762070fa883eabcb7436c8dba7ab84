      "message": "I\u0027m not familiar with this function on Windows. It sounds like it will have side-effects on the system on which the test is running, which isn\u0027t good practise. Could you add a message loop to ScreenDrawerWin instead of using a console window? Presumably then you could use the same test for all platforms.",

      "message": "This command (\u0027mode 1000,1000\u0027) impacts only the size of the command line prompt. Since Windows command line prompt is a single-process command line interceptor, changing its size should not impact other tests. (I do not expect a test to require a specific width or height of a command line prompt window. If so, it should do the same thing here to set it itself.)\n\nAdding a message loop for ScreenDrawerWin is pretty tricky, it requires a dedicate thread, and any painting operations need to be posted to the message loop. It breaks the assumption of the ScreenDrawer: the Draw*() commands are all synchronously.\n\nSo comparing to the complexity and the potential risk of using this command, I think using current console window should be a simpler approach.",
