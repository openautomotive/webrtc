In order not to expose new stats to the web platform without a corresponding chromium repo CL a whitelist has to be updated or else the [platform]_chromium_rel_ng chromium repo bots will fail on encountering non-whitelisted stats in a call between two tabs. I made the change, wait for this to land: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/618574. (These bots can manually be added to run with this webrtc repo CL if you like.)",

      "message": "This might be a tricky question, but the webrtc spec has a concept of a MediaStream and a MediaStreamTrack that is a bit different than our meaning of a \"audio stream\". A MediaStream is simply a collection of MediaStreamTracks, whereas here a stream is something which is receiving media. Is an audio MediaStreamTrack the same thing as an audio stream here?\n\nMy concern is what happens if a track jumps between streams. Does the track\u0027s samples counter (corresponding MediaStreamTrackStats.totalSamplesReceived, etc) keep increasing or is the samples counter replaced by a different \"stream\u0027s\" GetLifetimeStatistics?\n\nI\u0027m guessing this is correct but hard to say without more knowledge of webrtc codebase.",
