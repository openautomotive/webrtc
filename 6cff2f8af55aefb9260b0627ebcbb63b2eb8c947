      "message": "The naming here could be made more precise. I think \"Point\" is more commonly used than \"Spot\", and \"Occluded\" would be a better word than \"Hidden\", since there are multiple ways something could be hidden. So, I recommend changing this to IsPointOccluded (or just IsOccluded, since the fact that it operates on a single point is implicit in the method signature--your call though).\n\nCan this be made pure-virtual (and the implementation moved to the full-screen capturer). Your comment, above, explaining why the other methods can\u0027t be doesn\u0027t apply here, since it\u0027s a new method. If you have a concrete clean-up plan for pure-virtual-izing the other methods, then it\u0027s fine to leave this non-pure for consistency.",
