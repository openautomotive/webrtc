      "message": "The problem was too large stack, and it was caused by increasing this constant.\n\nUltimately, we would move an array from stack to heap. But I think this is fine to reduce this as a quick solution.\n\nWe changed this from 60 * 32 to 120 * 48, but actually, this CL only increased the allowed max sample rate from 32 to 48. So it is fine to maintain the \"60\" and it solves the stack problem.",
